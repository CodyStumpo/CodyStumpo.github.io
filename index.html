<h2>Repos related to Baseball</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/CodyStumpo/MLB-Playoff-Series">MLB Playoff Series</a> - Markov Chain to compute a team's chance of winning a major league baseball playoff series given starting pitchers, bullpen, and lineup strength vs. LHP or RHP</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/CodyStumpo/simpleWAR">Simple WAR calculator</a> - a Shiny app <a href="https://codystumpo.shinyapps.io/simpleWAR/">you can use</a> to evaluate the Wins Above Replacement of a hitter or pitcher given his performance in key aspects of the game.

<h2>Other Repos</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/CodyStumpo/Intrade_Pres_Election2008">2008 Presidential Election</a> - Mathematica code for a series of blog posts on Intrade, a prediction market.

<p><a href="https://github.com/CodyStumpo/Chipotle_Nutrition">Chipotle Nutrition</a> - Annoyed by the NY Times calorie-shaming analysis of data around 5000 detailed orders, I delved into the full nutritional content.  Also published as R Markdown <a href="http://rpubs.com/CodyStumpo/Chipotle">writeup</a>with some nifty visualizations</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DataKind-SF/datadive_201503_techsoup-global/blob/master/recommenderA/DataDive2015_TechSoup_Recommender.ipynb">DataKind</a> - volunteered to produce recommender system for TechSoup, a non-profit that coordinates IT donations to other non-profits.
