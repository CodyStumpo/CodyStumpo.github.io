<h2>Repos related to Baseball</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/CodyStumpo/MLB-Playoff-Series">MLB Playoff Series (R)</a> - Markov Chain to compute a team's chance of winning a major league baseball playoff series given starting pitchers, bullpen, and lineup strength vs. LHP or RHP</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/CodyStumpo/simpleWAR">Simple WAR calculator (R) </a> - a Shiny app <a href="https://codystumpo.shinyapps.io/simpleWAR/">you can use</a> to evaluate the Wins Above Replacement of a hitter or pitcher given his performance in key aspects of the game.  Helps you get a sense for how the elements interact to create value.</p>

<h2>Other Repos</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/CodyStumpo/Intrade_Pres_Election2008">2008 Presidential Election (Mathematica)</a> - Code for a series of blog posts on Intrade, a prediction market.  Combining portfolio simulation with the prediction market, I got a responsive, dynamic, and accurate predictor of the race. Also <a href="https://github.com/dreeves/pollsim">got it to publish live updates.</a>  Since Intrade is out of business (because regulators) the blog posts themselves are not well-archived but are more or less to be found <a href="http://stumpointrade.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2008-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&updated-max=2009-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&max-results=5">here</a>.  It'll make more sense if you scroll to the bottom and read up in chronological order.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/CodyStumpo/Chipotle_Nutrition">Chipotle Nutrition (R)</a> - Annoyed by the NY Times calorie-shaming analysis of data around 5000 detailed orders, I delved into the full nutritional content.  Also published as R Markdown <a href="http://rpubs.com/CodyStumpo/Chipotle">writeup</a> with some nifty visualizations</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DataKind-SF/datadive_201503_techsoup-global/blob/master/recommenderA/DataDive2015_TechSoup_Recommender.ipynb">DataKind (Python + R)</a> - volunteered to produce recommender system for TechSoup, a non-profit that coordinates IT donations to other non-profits.  Our team used a mix of clustering and random forests to generate recommendations for users that matched purchase behavior much better than any current approach.</p>
